Look in to launching a job in response to a client request, and
running the job as a daemon.  the job will send a message back to the
server when it's done, or if it dies (so must be wrapped; you'll need
a class to manage the job).  The server will maintain a Q of messages
for individual clients, so look in to Catalyst's authentication
chaining commands, too.  The client will have to poll or otherwise ask
for messages stored by the server (So we'll need some sort of timer
that fires off an ajax request for any pending messages).  See
jQuery.everyTime().
