16Oct:
- deploy trendweb on umatilla, buffy, aws
- implement bulk updates via ajax; or many concurrent ajax calls
- implement search
- implement user-defined phenos on ds edit page
- css trendweb

28Dec:
merge raw_samples, ds_samples into 'samples' table
- combine records, report on any conflicts (status?)
- don't touch original tables
- weed out spurious crap from ds_samples, eg keys=~/sample_/, _file_order, __table, 
- store path_rawdata where appropriate; get from filesystem.

combine GEO::RawSample and GEO::SeriesData
- fixes to GEO.pm (eg prefix, prefix2class, mongo, etc)
- merge attributes
- path() might be trickier? rs uses series path (or does it?)
- need two versions of as_vector?

need a script to generate perl code defining all attributes taken from a mongo db.



Rebuild database:

parse_soft.pl -> datasets, dataset_subsets, samples
 sample->dataset pointers
 sample->subset pointers
 word2geo for title, description

write GEO::*->display routines

parse_series.pl -> series, raw_samples
 field checking for series.csv; definitely some weirdness
 download only as necessary
 rs->gse pointers
 rs->path
 word2geo for title
 series->dataset pointers where they exist (series.csv[6])

RawSamples->next()
Series->next()
Dataset->next()
DatasetSubset->next()
Sample->next()		# for dataset samples

So: raw_samples->series_ID must be raw_samples->series_IDS; use case
  is GSM577841, which has at least two series attached: GSE23554 and GSE23603
